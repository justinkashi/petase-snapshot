Tasks to do 

1. Obtain functional annotation on petase dataset (interpro, blastp)

2. Obtain activity labels of the PEtase dataset (suppinfo, docking, tools) 

3. Finish the PETase-specific mutation table features (biophysical features) for remaining dataset. 

4. Code MLP head on PEtase dataset to predict stability, expression, activity

5. Read on fine-tuning, finish reading papers
