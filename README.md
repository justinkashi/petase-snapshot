* **Waiting meltome fasta**
* **Run the loading of allbenchmarkdf and export** 
* **Repackage process into .py and clean notebook** 

* Write embed esm3 esm2 seq struct 
* Write simple seq-struct mlp on stab/solub only on PET-ase (no function track)
* Transfer and compare the model to benchmark datasets with only seq-struct // establish global properties // establish local PET-specific properties with activity, mutation table, docking and maybe GNN/MDsim
* Write fine tuning (go through esmfinetune notebook)


* Get property tool results for PETase data
* fill activity ph labels 
* Finish the mutation table for each batch of petase 
* Check in on docking 
* read papers
