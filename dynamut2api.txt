DynaMut2
API - Documentation
Here we offer an API (Application Programming Interface) to assist users in integrating DynaMut2 into their research pipelines.

In summary, all jobs submitted to our server are labelled with a unique ID which is used to query the status (in queue, processing, processed).

Single Prediction - https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/dynamut2/api/prediction_single
POST - Job Submission
Arguments

pdb (optional) - 4 character PDB code
pdb_file (optional) - file in PDB format
chain (required) - Chain identifier
mutation(required) - Point mutation code (aaFrom + residueNumber + aaTo)
email (optional) - Email for contact when the job is finished
Return

job_id - ID used for uniquely identify each job
Examples

curl

$ curl https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/dynamut2/api/prediction_single -X POST -i -F pdb_file=@/home/ubuntu/1u46.pdb -F mutation=E346K -F chain=A
